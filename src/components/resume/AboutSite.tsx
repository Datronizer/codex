                This website serves as a portfolio for Chien "TrueOnGod" Truong. Here you can find my web development
                stuff, literary works, 3D artworks, photography, and other stuff I have done. Enjoy your stay!

                <strong>True, On God</strong> came from a harmless joke by one of my best friends.
                As he recalled: "I was just lying in bed one night, and thought about your last name, Truong.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thought, huh, if I broke it down, it would be Tru, On, G. True on God." And my
                new nickname was born, in the middle of a group call during a League match.
